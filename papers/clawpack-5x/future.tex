\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}

\todo{Add some concluding remarks here.}

\subsection{Future Work} \label{sub:future}

The \clawpack development team continues to look forward to new ideas and
efforts that will allow great accessibility to the project as well as new
capabilities that the core development team has not thought of.  To this end a
number of the broad efforts that are being looked at for the next major release
of \clawpack include
\begin{itemize}
    \item an increased librarization effort with the Fortran based sub-packages,
    \item an extensible and more accessible interface to the Riemann solvers,
    \item an effort to allow \pyclaw and the \clawpack Fortran packages to rely
    on more of the same code-base
    \item an increased emphasis on a larger development community, and
    \item more support for new frameworks such as \forestclaw.
\end{itemize}
