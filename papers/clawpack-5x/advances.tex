\section{Advances} \label{sec:advances}

This section is dedicated to the major changes in each of the code repositories.
A number of the repositories have seen only minor changes as the bulk of the
development is focused on current research interests.  There are a number of
minor changes not listed here and the interested reader is encouraged to refer
to both the change list at \url{http://www.clawpack.org/clawpack5.html} or the
\texttt{git} repositories them selves for a more complete list.
