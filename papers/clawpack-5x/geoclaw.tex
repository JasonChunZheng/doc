\subsection{\geoclaw} 

The \geoclaw branch of \clawpack originated with the work of George
\cite{dgeorge:masters, dgeorge:phd, dgeorge:jcp} 
solving the
two-dimensional shallow water equations using AMR under
conditions necessary for modeling tsunami generation, propagation, and
inundation.
The \amrclaw code formed the starting point but it was necessary to make many 
modifications to support the requirements of this application, as described
briefly below, and so a branch was created that was initially called
{\sc TsunamiClaw}.  Later it became clear that there were many other potential
applications with similar requirements when modeling a variety of
geophysical flows over varying topography that are shallow 
relative to their lateral extent.  This code was generalized to
become \geoclaw.

One of the major issues handled by \geoclaw is the handling of wetting and
drying of grid cells at margins of the flow, which required development of a
Riemann solver that robustly handled dry states.  The code also must be well-
balanced so that an ocean at rest remains at rest and waves with amplitudes that
are very small relative to the depth of the ocean are well resolved.  This
effectively means that topography, which appears as a source term in the
momentum equations, be incorporated into the Riemann solver rather than solving
with a fractional step approach.  The Riemann solver developed in
\cite{dgeorge:phd, dgeorge:jcp} achieves these objectives. Other features of
\geoclaw include the ability to solve the equations in latitude--longitude
coordinates on the surface of the sphere, and the incorporation of source terms
modeling bottom friction using a Manning formulation. More details about the
code and tsunami modeling applications can be found in
\cite{BergerGeorgeLeVequeMandli:awr11, LeVequeGeorgeBerger:an11}. In 2011, a
significant effort took place to verify and validate \geoclaw against the US
National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) benchmarks
\cite{GonzalezLeVequeEtAl2011}.
NTHMP approval of the code allows \geoclaw to be used in hazard mapping 
projects that are funded by this program or other federal and state agencies,
e.g.
\cite{GonzalezLeVequeEtAl2013a,GonzalezLeVequeEtAl2014}.

In addition to a variety of tsunami modeling applications,
\geoclaw has been used to solve dam break problems in steep terrain
\cite{George:Malpasset}, storm surge problems \cite{Mandli:ws} demonstrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:surge},
and submarine landslides \cite{jhkim:phd}.  The code also
formed the basis for solving the 
multi-layer shallow water equations for storm surge modeling
\cite{mandli:phd, Mandli:2013it},
and is currently being extended further to handle debris flow modeling in the
packages D-Claw
\cite{Iverson:2014dc,George:2014gh} demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:meager}.

Roughly one third of the files in the \amrclaw source library have to be
modified for \geoclaw. There are currently 135 files in the \amrclaw 2D branch.
Forty-five of them are replaced by a \geoclaw-specific file of the same name but
in the \geoclaw 2D branch. For example, to keep a flat sea level when
interpolating, it is necessary to account for topography. This implies that the
water height plus topography is interpolated rather than just interpolating the
conserved quantity, which is the default behavior in
\amrclaw.

Several other substantial improvements in the
algorithms implemented in \geoclaw have been made between versions 4.6 and
5.3.0, including:

\begin{itemize} 
\item In depth-averaged flow the wave speed and therefore the CFL condition depends on the depth.  Thus in shallow water spatially refined grids may not need to be refined in time.  This ``variable-time-stepping'' was easily added along with the anisotropic capabilities that were added to \amrclaw.

\item the ability to specify topography via a set of {\tt
topo} files that may cover overlapping regions at different resolutions. The
finite volume method requires cell averages of topography, computed by
integrating a piecewise bilinear function constructed from the input {\tt
topo} files over each grid cell.  In 5.1.0, this was improved to 
allow an arbitrary number of nested {\tt topo} grids.
When adaptive mesh refinement is used,
regridding may take place every few time steps.  Improvements were made 
in 5.2.0 so that topography could be copied rather than always being
recomputed in regions where there is an old grid at the same resolution to
copy from. 

\item The user can also provide {\tt dtopo} files that specify changes to the
initial topography at a series of times.  This is used to specify sea-floor
motion during a tsunamigenic earthquake, but can also be used to specify
submarine landslide motion or a failing dam, for example. Major changes were
made to these algorithms in 5.1.0 to fix a problem in earlier versions that
resulted in incorrect topography motion in some cases, also resulting in a much
more robust handling of multiple  {\tt dtopo} files.

\item A number of new Python modules have been developed to assist the user
in working with {\tt topo} and {\tt dtopo} files.  These are documented in
the Clawpack documentation and several of them are illustrated with Jupyter
notebooks found in the Clawpack Gallery.

\item New capabilities were added in 5.0.0 to monitor the maximum of various
flow quantities over a specified time range of a simulation.  This capability is
crucial for many applications such as tsunami hazard assessment, where the
maximum flow depth at each point in a community is desired, maximum current
velocities in a harbor, or maximum momentum flux (a measure of the hydrodynamic
force that would be exerted by the flow on a structure).  Arrival time of the
first wave at each point can also be monitored.  Some such capabilities were
included in the 4.x version of the code, but were more limited and did not
always perform properly near the edges of refinement patches.  
In Version 5.2 these routines were further improved and extended.  
The user can
specify a grid of points on which to monitor values, and the new code is more
flexible in allowing one-dimensional grids (e.g. a transect), two-dimensional
rectangular grids, or an arbitrary set of points.
