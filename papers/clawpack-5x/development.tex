\section{Development Approach}

\subsection{Github organization, subrepositories}
Clawpack includes several related software projects, each of which is managed in its own repository on Github.  These projects are sub-repositories of the high-level Clawpack repository and are assigned to the Clawpack Github organization.  The set of maintainers -- with push and merge privileges -- is different for each sub-repository.

The main solver repositories are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Riemann (Riemann solvers used by all the other projects)
    \item Classic
    \item \amrclaw
    \item \geoclaw
    \item \pyclaw
\end{itemize}

Additional repositories contain documentation and extended examples of using the code:
\begin{itemize}
    \item doc
    \item apps
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development Model}
\begin{itemize}
    \item forks, master, branches, pull requests
    \item travis CI
\end{itemize}
